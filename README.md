### GRE 🧐

#### 词汇
1. 词源
``` markdown
接下来请按照以下规则完成任务。 
词源规则： 接下来我将输入一个或者多个英文单词。请根据我输入的英文词汇，列举出该单词的以下内容： 1. 该单词的词源，即该单词来自哪种语言或哪个单词，并解释该单词的含义和词源故事； 2. 该单词的词根和词缀，即该单词由哪些部分组成，每个部分的含义是什么，以及如何帮助您理解该单词的含义； 3. Memory tips，即如何记忆和运用该单词，以及该单词与哪些相关概念或单词有关联;  4. Example sentences，即该单词在句子中的用法和意义.
如果我输入多个英文单词，我会用逗号将不同的单词隔开。 在这种情况下，你要按照以下顺序输出： 首先输出第一个单词的词源， 词根词缀， memory tips, example sentences.  然后按照这个格式输出第二个单词的内容，以此类推。
例如：
我输入“decadence”
你应该理解我是要求你输出“decadence”相关的如下信息，并应该按照以下格式输出相关信息：
“词源：Decadence这个词来自于法语单词“décadence”，源自拉丁文中的“de”（下降）和“cadere”（跌倒）。
词根词缀：Decadence的词根是cadence，意为“节奏、韵律、步伐”，前缀de-表示“不、下降”。
Memory tips：可以将Decadence与“衰落”和“腐败”联系起来。这个词通常用来描述文化、社会或制度的衰落和腐败，经常与道德堕落、颓废和堕落等概念相关。
Example sentences:
The city's once-beautiful architecture has fallen into a state of decadence and disrepair.
Some argue that the widespread use of technology is contributing to a moral decadence in society.
The artist's work was marked by a sense of decadence and decay, reflecting the decline of the society in which he lived.”
```

```md
Word Origin Rule: After I receive your confirmation, I will provide one or more English words. Based on the English vocabulary I provide, please list the following information about the word(s):
Word origin, which means where the word comes from and the story behind its meaning and etymology.
Word roots and affixes, which means the parts of the word and their meanings, and how they help you understand the word's meaning.
Memory tips, which means how to remember and use the word, and what concepts or words it is associated with.
Example sentences, which means how the word is used in a sentence and its meaning.
If I provide multiple English words, I will separate them with commas. In this case, you should output the following information in the following order: first output the word origin, word roots and affixes, memory tips, and example sentences for the first word. Then output the same information in the same format for the second word, and so on.
For example:
If I input "decadence," I'm asking you to output the following information related to "decadence," and you should output the information in the following format:

"Word Origin: The word "decadence" comes from the French word "décadence," which is derived from the Latin "de" (down) and "cadere" (to fall).
Word Roots and Affixes: The root of "decadence" is "cadence," which means "rhythm, melody, or pace," and the prefix "de-" means "down" or "not."
Memory Tips: You can associate "decadence" with "decline" and "decay." This word is often used to describe the decline and decay of culture, society, or institutions and is often associated with concepts of moral decay, decadence, and degeneration.
Example Sentences:
The city's once-beautiful architecture has fallen into a state of decadence and disrepair.
Some argue that the widespread use of technology is contributing to a moral decadence in society.
The artist's work was marked by a sense of decadence and decay, reflecting the decline of the society in which he lived."
